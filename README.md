# Diabetes Prediction ML Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The model is built using a dataset containing medical predictor variables and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains the following columns:

1. **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
2. **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
8. **Age**: Age (years)
9. **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) where 1 indicates diabetes and 0 indicates no diabetes

## Requirements

To run the model and the associated scripts, you will need the following libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
